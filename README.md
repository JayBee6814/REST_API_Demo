<h2><b>SIMPLE REST_API DEMO</b></h2>

This is a simple example of how to consume an API and then display the results in a HTML table. This was a project used in 
my Graduate School User Interface Class where We had to connect to a derby database, create the REST_API, then consume it in a web application.
The purpose of the project was to create a fictional app for the Maryland State Police where they would use it to identify 
Vehicles of Interest. They could search the database by field name and field value. Once a hit is found it is presented in an HTML Table. 

This is the mobile landing page. Here is where the user initiates the use of the MSP Vehicle of Interest Mobile Database.

Here is the second screen shot. Here the user is shown selecting “Reason” from the drop down list and entering a value of “Amber Alert”. This will search the MSP VOI database and return all the records with a value of “Amber Alert”.

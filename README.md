<b>SIMPLE REST_API DEMO</b>

This is a simple example of how to consume an API and then display the results in a HTML table. This was a project used in 
my Graduate School User Interface Class where We had to connect to a derby database, create the REST_API, then consume it in a web application.
The purpose of the project was to create a fictional app for the Maryland State Police where they would use it to identify 
Vehicles of Interest. They could search the database by field name and field value. Once a hit is found it is presented in an HTML Table.
